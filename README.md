# Travelling-Salesman-Problem
The algorithm employed to address the symmetric problem proposed by this project is the branch and bound algorithm. When the system initiates, it begins by reading the file containing the city list. Subsequently, it captures the data for each city, encapsulates it within an object, and aggregates these objects into an Array List of cities. Following this, it generates a distance matrix, delineating the distances between different cities, designating the distance between the same city as infinity.

The system then designates the first city in the Array List of cities as the initial point for all potential routes to solve the TSP problem. A vertex is created using this initial point. Each vertex retains information about the path taken thus far, the remaining cities, and its associated cost. To calculate the cost of the vertex, the algorithm first sets all values in the row of the last visited city and the column of the current city to infinity. Additionally, it sets the distance between the current city and the last visited city to infinity. Subsequently, the algorithm reduces the initially generated distance matrix at the system's starting point. During this reduction process, the algorithm identifies the minimum value in each column and row, subsequently reducing the columns and rows using the minimum values found. Each time the matrix is reduced, the algorithm records the sum of all the minimum values utilized in the reduction. Prior to reducing the matrix, the algorithm checks whether the matrix is already reduced by inspecting the presence of zeros in each column and row or if an entire column or row is populated by infinity values.

Upon matrix reduction, the algorithm computes the cost of the vertex by summing the cost of the last visited city's vertex, the distance between the last visited city and the current city, and the cumulative cost of all reductions made thus far. Subsequently, the vertex removes the current city from the remaining cities and adds it to the visited cities. Until a vertex with a complete path is obtained, the system continually generates new vertices. With each generation of new vertices, the system identifies the vertex with the minimum cost and explores that particular path. Upon discovering a vertex with a complete path, the system examines all generated vertices to identify one with a lower cost than the current one. If such a vertex is found, the system explores the newly identified vertex. Each time a vertex with a complete path is encountered, the system stores it. Ultimately, the system compares all vertices with complete paths to determine the optimal route for the TSP problem.
